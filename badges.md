# Server Badges and Tags

Servers are assigned to  one or multiple badges that they conform to. Some badges may redirect to an external link that the servers generally refer to, e.g., a homepage or official repository. A badge doesn't necessarily mean that the server is better than the others; it's to represent a server's validity, activity, and wiki. Badges selected for a server **doesn't** relate to [Discord's own set of badges](https://discordia.me/en/badges).

#### Git Badge

The server has an open git repository which may contain useful resources, Discord bot, and other developments. This clickable badge redirects to the hosted repository e.g., GitHub, Gitlab.

## Tags

Some servers contain these tags. Tags are nothing but a reference to something generic to save space.

##### `so much more`

A community with wide range of topics, each of them are equally productive in activity. It has so many active channels that it's impossible to sqeeze in all of them in `Notable channels`.

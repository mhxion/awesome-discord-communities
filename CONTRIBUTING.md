## New Community

To add a new community, fork this project and add your server to a section or sebsection, or you can include a new section if need be, then [create a pull request](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md). Make sure your proposal meets these requirements below, if you've Python installed you can take advantage of this [script](src/README.md).

✅ Each community follows this template

```html
<img align="left" height="94px" width="94px" alt="Server Icon" src="<static url of the image>" />

[__Community Name__](url of invite link) [<img height="16px" width="16px" alt="Official Badge" src="images/badges/official.webp">](badges.md#official-identification-badge) [<img height="16px" width="16px" alt="Reddit Badge" src="images/badges/reddit.webp">](badges.md#reddit-badge) [<img height="16px" width="16px" alt="Homepage URL" src="images/badges/homepage.webp">](url of server homepage) [<img height="16px" width="16px" alt="Git Repository" src="images/badges/git.webp">](url of server git repository) \

## Issues

If you've found an issue with an existing server or have a suggestion to make to improve this list, feel free to file a an issue [here](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/issues/new/choose).

## Review Policy

Review policy is meant for reviewers, not necessarily for contributors. There is no real metric provided by Discord that can be used by anyone to evaluate a server. However a maintainer will manually review the community for a period of time (1-4 days) before it can get accepted.

Only technical or technology-related communities are considered as an initial requirement. A community that is meant for people to hang out with no real active support channel will not be considered as technical. There are certain categories a technical community can be attributed to. **Generic**, **Niche**, and **Project**. There are a few distinct requirements for each of them.

[Generic servers](./README.md#programming-in-general) try to address multiple-technical-domains-in-one instead a specific, i.e., a server that offers support for all programming languages vs. a server that offers Java only. These communities are most likely to attract a lot of people in a short period of time, and  more likely to be short-lived as it becomes more and more difficult to maintain over time. For this reason, a stricter requirement, a generic server needs to be at least a year old with active moderation and messaging activity on a daily basis (excluding the off-topic channels). This particular precondition affects generic servers only.

Niche servers are the opposite of Generics, they're geared toward a smaller domain. The required minimum age is six months. Communities related to cryptocurrencies are often prone to the risk of getting hacked, for this reason - for now only open-source owned official cryptocurrency servers will be allowed.

Project servers are part of the associate communities of open-source projects or content creators (e.g., Twitch streamers, YouTube creators). Since the activity and growth of the server depends on the creator's content itself, they can be accepted as soon as there is daily or semiweekly activity. If you maintain an open-source project you might also be interested in [Discord's own open-source recognition](https://discord.com/open-source).
